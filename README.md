# Embedded Systems Assignment 2: CarDetection Algorithm On QEMU

#### Please refer to the pdf file in the repository for instructions on how to run the project

### Project Description:
This assignment involved running a car detection algorithm on two different architectures, x86_64 and ARM64, using QEMU to simulate virtual machines. Both systems were set up with Debian operating systems and equipped with Python, OpenCV, and the required dependencies to execute the program. The algorithm processes video frames individually, detecting cars and marking them with bounding boxes.
